# This option allows to add to SPDX output compressed archives of the sources for packages installed on the target. It

# This option allows to add a description of the source files used to build the host tools and the target packages, to
# the spdx.json files in tmp/deploy/spdx/MACHINE/recipes/ under the Build Directory. As a consequence, the spdx.json
# files under the by-namespace and packages subdirectories in tmp/deploy/spdx/MACHINE are also modified to include
# references to such source file descriptions.

# This option makes the SPDX output more human-readable, using identation and newlines, instead of the default output in
# a single line. The generated SPDX files are approximately 20% bigger, but this option is recommended if you want to
# inspect the SPDX output files with a text editor.
